# File Encryption/Decryption Tool

## Description
This project is a simple file encryption and decryption tool developed in C++ that uses the AES encryption algorithm. The tool provides an easy way to secure sensitive data by allowing users to encrypt and decrypt files using a randomly generated encryption key. It demonstrates the basic process of reading, encrypting, and writing data to files, making it a great starting point for learning about file manipulation and encryption techniques.

## Features
- Generate a random encryption key for secure data protection.
- Encrypt files using the AES encryption algorithm to safeguard sensitive information.
- Decrypt previously encrypted files to restore original content.
- Basic command-line interface for user interaction.
- Educational and practical example for understanding encryption concepts and C++ programming.

## Requirements
-C++ compiler.
-OpenSSL library (for AES encryption).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler that supports the required libraries.
3. Run the compiled executable and follow the command-line prompts to encrypt and decrypt files.
